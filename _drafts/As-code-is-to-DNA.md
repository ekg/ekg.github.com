### There are few places where you can see the accelerating convergence of biology and math more clearly than when confronting the problem of observing the genome

In genomics we first want to render the chemical sequences that lie inside the cell into digital ones that we can then operate on using digital techniques in computers.
We want to do this because it allows us to operate in the space of pure data and explore the relationship between things using computational techniques that are reproducible, general, and shareable.
In doing so we can connect new things we observe into a web of data and directl yconnect enormous networks of experimental information when we do our inferences.

If you are a computer scientist this description may seem banal. Of course we operate on things in a digital context. That is definitional.
But to a biologist this is not a given. A biologist traditionally seeks to understand systems purely through the observation of interactions in the physical domain. The possibility of modeling our way to conclusions in a new one, and it depends on an array of techinical advances, which like so many others in the present era, are driven by a massive reduction in the cost of compute, which we have used to reduce the cost of running algorithms over data to impressively low levels.

For much of the history of biology, physical experimentation has been the only way to learn about the operation of biological systems. The approach is just, and when well implemented can be the best possible generative and exploratory approach. But it is problematic because of the slow pace of experimentation. Each new interaction to test implies a new experiment. This would be fine but the number of interactions is humblingly large, and experiments have been hard to run.

Inside of a cell are billions of proteins, each one spinning at up to a million times a second and rapidly traversing the volume of the entire cell. There are membranes of lipids, complex structures made of sugars, and the combinations of all of these things. Long polymers with complex sequences encode information that describes the system: plans, signals, and plans for signals that generate interactions within the system and which in turn drive the creation of larger structures, the consumption of substrates, and other activities. There is a very large probability that any two bits of this system will interact in a surprisingly short period of time, creating vast networks of relationships with astronomically large state spaces that we can't ignore when we try to reason about the system.

Emerging from this mess is us and of course not only us but also everything we eat, nearly everything we see, and the entirety of the only home we know. Our whole world somehow emerges from this crazy process.

As this is too much for any one person to really understand at its fundamental level of detail, we need ways to aggregate our knowledge and pool our effort.
Our only hope to have traction in the space is to integrate results from amany sources and build inclusive models to drive our understanding.
This means math consumes biology, and as it consumes it, computing technology drives it forward.

### Genomes are a compressed representation of life that we can nearly understand as a source code for living thinsg.

Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was named when only the roughest details of its nature were understood. Its cryptic name derives from the fact that it is a negatively charged polymer that is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. As we learned, it can achieve tremendous lengths--- despite being only a millionth of a meter in diameter, each human cell containts around two meters of DNA. Further investigation using x-ray crystallography showed it to be composed of two complementary molecules bound by hydrogen bonds between side chains hung from each molecule's sugar phosphate backbone. Due to the pattern of hydrogen bonding between them, the pairing of these groups is specific, and only certain pairs are stable. These observations clarified the provenance of DNA: it provides a mechanism to copy the information required to organize a cell. By splitting the strands and using each one as a template for a new complementary strand, two nearly exact copies can be made from a single starting molecule. Further research affirmed that changes to the DNA would manifest in differences between organisms, indicating that DNA was the core mechanism for the transmission and organization of information required to create and sustain life.

DNA contains genes, which are abstract functional units of DNA sequences which can be transcribed into RNA, which is a less stable biomolecule that serves as a kind of working memory or buffer in the transfer of information from the DNA into the rest of the cell. These genes were identified before DNA was understood on a structural level, and for their existence we call th eaggregate of DNA in a cell or organism its genome.

While DNA encodes the information required to maintain life, it alone is not enough to give rise to living things. At no point in the history of a given genome has it been completely isolated. It is always embedded in a living thing.

### As we learn to modify their code, we learn to design life.

### What can be coded can be shared and reproduced.

### So the ability to code living things will also enable us to work together on common projects that span the world.
